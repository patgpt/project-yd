## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, having a strong online presence is crucial for any business or individual. A well-designed website can help you reach a wider audience, showcase your work, and achieve your goals. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of building a modern, responsive, and high-performance website using two of the most powerful tools in the Vue.js ecosystem: **Nuxt.js** and **Vuetify**.

### Why Choose Nuxt and Vuetify?

**Nuxt.js** is a powerful framework for building server-rendered Vue.js applications. It comes with a host of features out of the box, including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-system based routing, and more. These features make it an excellent choice for building fast, SEO-friendly websites.

**Vuetify** is a comprehensive UI component library for Vue.js that follows Google's Material Design specifications. It provides a vast collection of pre-built components, from buttons and forms to complex data tables and navigation drawers. By using Vuetify, you can save a significant amount of time and effort in designing and building your website's user interface.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm, pnpm, or Bun

Once you have everything set up, you can create a new Nuxt project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-awesome-website
```

This will create a new Nuxt project in a directory called `my-awesome-website`. Navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd my-awesome-website
npm install
```

### Adding Vuetify

Next, we'll add Vuetify to our project. We'll use the official `@invictus.codes/nuxt-vuetify` module, which makes it easy to integrate Vuetify with Nuxt.

```bash
npm install @invictus.codes/nuxt-vuetify
```

Then, add the module to your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@invictus.codes/nuxt-vuetify"],
});
```

## Building the Layout

Now that we have our project set up, let's create a basic layout for our website. We'll create a default layout that includes a navigation bar, a main content area, and a footer.

Create a new file at `layouts/default.vue` and add the following code:

```vue
<template>
  <v-app>
    <v-app-bar app>
      <v-toolbar-title>My Awesome Website</v-toolbar-title>
      <v-spacer></v-spacer>
      <v-btn text to="/">Home</v-btn>
      <v-btn text to="/about">About</v-btn>
    </v-app-bar>

    <v-main>
      <v-container>
        <slot />
      </v-container>
    </v-main>

    <v-footer app>
      <span>&copy; {{ new Date().getFullYear() }}</span>
    </v-footer>
  </v-app>
</template>
```

This layout provides a simple structure for our website. We can now create our pages and they will automatically use this layout.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've covered the basics of building a website with Nuxt.js and Vuetify. We've learned how to set up a new project, add Vuetify, and create a basic layout. From here, you can start building out your pages and adding more features to your website.

Happy coding!
