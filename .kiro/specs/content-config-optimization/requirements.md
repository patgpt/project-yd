# Content Configuration Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the optimization of the Nuxt Content configuration to provide a seamless editing experience with Nuxt Studio. The goal is to restructure the content schema to use reusable data types, improve component architecture for better editor integration, and leverage YAML files for enhanced form editing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reusable Data Collections

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want to manage reusable content like FAQs, testimonials, pricing plans, and authors separately so that I can maintain consistency across pages and avoid duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a testimonial THEN it SHALL be stored as a separate data collection that can be referenced by multiple pages
2. WHEN I create an FAQ THEN it SHALL be stored as a reusable data collection accessible across different pages
3. WHEN I create a pricing plan THEN it SHALL be stored as a data collection that can be referenced by landing pages
4. WHEN I create an author profile THEN it SHALL be stored as a data collection that can be referenced by blog posts
5. IF I update a reusable data item THEN all pages referencing it SHALL reflect the changes automatically

### Requirement 2: YAML-First Data Structure

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want to use YAML files for data management so that I can benefit from Nuxt Studio's form editor interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit testimonials THEN I SHALL use a YAML file with Studio's form editor
2. WHEN I edit FAQs THEN I SHALL use a YAML file with Studio's form editor
3. WHEN I edit pricing plans THEN I SHALL use a YAML file with Studio's form editor
4. WHEN I edit author profiles THEN I SHALL use a YAML file with Studio's form editor
5. IF I need to add new data items THEN the form editor SHALL provide appropriate input types (media picker, icon picker, etc.)

### Requirement 3: Component Architecture for Studio Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to be properly structured with slots so that they integrate seamlessly with Nuxt Studio's visual editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create content components THEN they SHALL be located in `app/components/content/` directory
2. WHEN I design components THEN they SHALL use Vue slots for content areas that editors need to modify
3. WHEN I create components THEN they SHALL accept props for configuration while using slots for content
4. IF a component displays dynamic data THEN it SHALL support both direct props and data collection references
5. WHEN components are used in MDC syntax THEN they SHALL be automatically available in Studio's component picker

### Requirement 4: Improved Schema Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized schema structure that separates concerns and reduces duplication while maintaining type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define schemas THEN common patterns SHALL be extracted into reusable schema functions
2. WHEN I create data collections THEN they SHALL have clear, focused schemas without unnecessary complexity
3. WHEN I reference data from other collections THEN the schema SHALL support proper relationships
4. IF I need to extend a schema THEN it SHALL be possible without duplicating base definitions
5. WHEN I use the schema THEN TypeScript types SHALL be automatically generated and accurate

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Editor Experience

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want an intuitive editing experience where I can easily manage content relationships and see live previews of my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit a page THEN I SHALL be able to select from existing testimonials, FAQs, and other reusable content
2. WHEN I create new reusable content THEN it SHALL immediately be available for selection in other pages
3. WHEN I use components in the visual editor THEN they SHALL display properly with editable slots
4. IF I need to add media THEN the media picker SHALL be available for appropriate fields
5. WHEN I save changes THEN the preview SHALL update to reflect the modifications

### Requirement 6: Content Relationship Management

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to establish clear relationships between different content types so that I can maintain data integrity and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I assign an author to a blog post THEN I SHALL select from existing author profiles
2. WHEN I add testimonials to a page THEN I SHALL select from the testimonials collection
3. WHEN I configure pricing sections THEN I SHALL reference pricing plan data collections
4. IF I delete a referenced data item THEN the system SHALL handle the relationship gracefully
5. WHEN I view content relationships THEN I SHALL be able to see which pages reference specific data items
